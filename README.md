# 🕵️‍♂️ DevDetector

**DevDetector** is a simple browser-based application built with **vanilla JavaScript**. It detects and displays key information about the user's browser, operating system, and device environment.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to use built-in **JavaScript browser APIs** to access environment-related data without using any libraries or frameworks.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🌐 Detect browser name and version
- 💻 Show user's operating system/platform
- 📱 Display device-related information (like screen size, user agent)
- ✅ Simple and clean user interface

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanket-darunkar/DevDetector.git
   cd DevDetector
   \`\`\`

2. Open the \`index.html\` file in your browser:
   \`\`\`bash
   open index.html
   \`\`\`
   Or simply double-click it in your file explorer.

## 📘 Key Concepts

- **navigator object**: Used to fetch user agent, platform, and browser info.
- **window.screen**: Used to get screen resolution and dimensions.
- **User agent parsing**: Basic string operations to extract data.
